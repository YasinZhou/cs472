    1. What is the main value of Java Server Pages?<br>

    Java Server Pages can separate display from processing, i.e., separate html from java. It can develope web pages that support dynamic content, allowing developers to insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, this will eliminate the need to code complex output streams from the response object to produce a view.<br>

    2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?<br>

    Servlet is java with some html mixed in, and JSP is html with a little java mixed in. After server with JSP container read the jsp pages from client, JVM will compile a jsp into servlet and then execute request processing phase. JSP will help servlet to do the codes of output streams from the response object to produce a view.<br>

    3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?<br>

    JSP is html with a little java mixed in. It can help html from static to add dynamic content. The client send the request with JSP pages to the server with JSP container. The JSP container will response the html dynamically to the client.<br>

    MVC: there are some JavaBean deal with the logic parts and store data, we call it as model. The servlet is called as controller, it received the request, deal with it, and access model then send the response to JSP, which is called view.<br>

    4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet .<br>

    <%out.println("Q4");%><br>
    out.println("Q4");<br>

    5. Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.<br>

    <%! int i = 0; %><br>
    int i = 0;<br>

    6. Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.<br>

    <%-- Not shown--%><br>
    //Not shown<br>

    7. Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.<br>

    <%= (new java.util.Date()).toLocaleString()%><br>
    (new java.util.Date()).toLocaleString()<br>

    8. Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.<br>

    <%@ page import="java.util.Date" %><br>
    import java.util.Date;<br>

    9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.<br>

    EL expression provides many implicit objects that we can use to get attributes from different scopes and parameter values easily using HTML like tags.<br>

    10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.<br>

    1.Checks page scope for an attribute named "something",if found use it. 2.Otherwise check request scope for an attribute named "something",if found use it. 3.Otherwise check session scope for an attribute named "something",if found use it 4.Otherwise check application scope for an attribute named "something",if found use it. 5.Otherwise ignore the expression.<br>

    11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.<br>

    There is a servlet that acts as a controller that sets attribute values based on computations and results from a business model, then dispatches the request to the servlet generated by the JSP page. The JSP servlet then retrieves the attribute values and inserts them into the designated places in the HTML being sent to the browser. They do this by JSP call another JSP, JSP and Servlet call each other,<br>
